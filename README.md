# SQL DataWare House

### Welcome to the my ***Data Warehouse*** Journey ðŸš€ <br>
Building a modern data warehouse using Microsoft SQL Serve I complete this project with #DatawithBaraa and in this Journey my best part is Project Planing, Designing and Data Cleaning. In project planing I learn How to plan project for best output, I plan everthing for this project in Draw io and this is best experience for me.
